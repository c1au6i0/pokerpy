The aim of this project is to develop in `python` the classical power game, and in the process learn more about `python`,
probability and game theory and deep inside about our-selves and the meaning of life.

We are well aware that there are many other people that did it already (es: https://pypi.org/project/poker/), but again this is an exercise for us, and being able to take a peak at the work of someone else (probabily more experience then us) is even better.
