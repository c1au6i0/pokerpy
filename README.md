# pokerpy

*authors: DottorDav. & c1au6i0*

The aim of this project is to develop in `python` the classical power game, and in the process to learn more about `python`,
probability and game theory and deep inside about our-selves and the meaning of life.

We are well aware that there are many other people that did it already in python (es: [link](https://pypi.org/project/poker/)) 
and that poker is quite complex, but again this is an exercise for us, and being able to take a peak at the work of someone 
else (much more experience then us) makes it even more informative.
