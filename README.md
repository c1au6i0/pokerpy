# pokerpy

*authors: DottorDav. & c1au6i0*

The aim of this project is to develop the classical poker game in python, and in the process to learn more about `python`,
probability and game theory and, about  the meaning of life.

We are well aware that there are many other people that did it already in python and that poker is quite complex, but again this is an exercise for us, and being able to take a peak at the work of someone else (much more experience then us) makes it even more informative.
